# CheckKit

A flexible, configurable checklist widget for Figma built with modern TypeScript architecture. CheckKit allows you to create dynamic checklists from any data source with clean, modular components and automatic date tracking.

The widget features three checkbox states (empty, partial, complete) with smooth gray monochrome styling and rounded square design. Every checkbox interaction automatically updates the "last modified" date, providing instant feedback without requiring forms or user input. The modular architecture supports custom themes, multiple data formats, and easy integration into any Figma workflow.

Built with a universal configuration system, CheckKit can consume data from JSON, plain text, string arrays, or existing checklist objects. Simply provide a title and list of items, and the widget handles the rest - making it perfect for QA checklists, design reviews, project tasks, or any workflow that needs trackable progress indicators.
